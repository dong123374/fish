abstract ：Fish feeding behavior is critical in aquaculture management.  Previous methods have primarily relied on analyzing fry school behavior, overlooking individual fish dynamics.  Multi-target trajectory tracking algorithms offer a promising approach to quantify individual fry behavior, providing deeper insights into feeding patterns.  However, current multi-target fry tracking methods are limited by  low-quality images, small targets, frequent occlusions, and fragmented trajectories.In order to solve these problems, we proposed an improved multi-target tracking algorithm, which can effectively improve the detection of sand goby fry in the real scene, so as to better understand the real feeding situation.
